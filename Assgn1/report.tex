\noindent The included folders consists of the Python 2 script, C
source code (in the required questions) as well as an Ipython notebook
for each question describing what is being done in the code.

\section*{Question 1}

\vspace{5pt}

In this question, an element in the Fibonacci Series is calculated
by the formula: $$a[n] = a[n-1] + a[n-2]$$ where 1\textsuperscript{st}
\& 2\textsuperscript{nd} elements are 1.

\section*{Question 2}

\vspace{5pt}

In this question, the first 1000 elements in the series are calculated
using the equation: $$n[k] = fractional\hspace{3pt} part\hspace{3pt} of\hspace{3pt} (n[k-1] + \pi ) \times 100$$
where 1\textsuperscript{st}  element is 0.2.

\section*{Question 3}

\vspace{5pt}

The given text file is read and the count of each word is calculated
using a dictionary (after removing punctuations and making all letters
lower case). Then, the 10 most frequent words are displayed.
